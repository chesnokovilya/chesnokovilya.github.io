<h1>Three poems about nature by Emily Dickinson </h1>

<h2 id="hh1">THE ROBIN</h2>
THE ROBIN is the one  
That interrupts the morn  
With hurried, few, express reports  
When March is scarcely on.  
  
The robin is the one          
That overflows the noon 
With her cherubic quantity, 
An April but begun. 
  
The robin is the one  
That speechless from her nest         
Submits that home and certainty 
And sanctity are best.

<h2 id="hh2">I KNOW</h2>
I KNOW a place where summer strives 
With such a practised frost,  
She each year leads her daisies back, 
Recording briefly, “Lost.”  
  
But when the south wind stirs the pools         
And struggles in the lanes, 
Her heart misgives her for her vow, 
And she pours soft refrains 
  
Into the lap of adamant,  
And spices, and the dew,          
That stiffens quietly to quartz,  
Upon her amber shoe.

<h2 id="hh3">THE LEAVES</h2>
THE LEAVES, like women, interchange 
Sagacious confidence; 
Somewhat of nods, and somewhat of 
Portentous inference, 
  
The parties in both cases         
Enjoining secrecy,— 
Inviolable compact  
To notoriety.
